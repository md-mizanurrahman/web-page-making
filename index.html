            COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- A U.S. military laboratory has helped Swedes confirm what was suspected
            for years: A
            woman
            was among those who died on a 17th-century warship that sank on its maiden voyage, the museum
            that displays
            the
            ship
            said Tuesday. <br>

            The wreck of the royal warship Vasa was raised in 1961, and was remarkably well-preserved after
            more than
            300
            years
            underwater in the Stockholm harbor. It has since been place at the Vasa Museum, one of
            Stockholm’s top
            tourist
            attractions where visitors can admire its intricate wooden carvings. <br>

            Some 30 people died when the Vasa keeled over and sank just minutes after leaving port in 1628.
            They are
            believed to
            have been crew members and most of their identities are unknown. <br>

            For years, there were indications that one of the victims, known as G, was a woman, because of
            the
            appearance of
            the
            hip bone, Fred Hocker, research leader at the Vasa Museum, said in a statement. <br>

            Anna Maria Forsberg, a historian with the Vasa Museum, told The Associated Press that women were
            not part of
            the
            crew in the Swedish navy in the 17th century, but they could be on board as guests. Seamen were
            allowed to
            have
            their wives with them onboard unless the ship was going into battle or going for a long journey.
            <br>

            “We know from written sources that around 30 people died that day," Forsberg said. “It is thus
            likely that
            she
            was a
            seaman’s wife who wanted to come along on the maiden journey of this new, impressive ship.” <br>

            She said the exact number of people on board that day was not known “but we think there were
            around 150
            people.
            An
            additional 300 soldiers were supposed to board further out in the archipelago,” she said. <br>

            Since 2004, the Vasa Museum collaborated with the Department of Immunology, Genetics and
            Pathology at
            Uppsala
            University, which examined all the skeletons on Vasa in order to find out as much as possible
            about the
            various
            individuals on the doomed vessel. <br>

            “It is very difficult to extract DNA from bones that have been on the seabed for 333 years, but
            not
            impossible,”
            Marie Allen, professor of forensic genetics at Uppsala University said in the statement. “Simply
            put, we
            found
            no Y
            chromosomes in G’s genome. But we couldn’t be completely sure and we wanted to have the results
            confirmed.” <br>

            So they turned to the Delaware-based Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory. And thanks to
            the forensics
            laboratory specializing in DNA profiling at the Dover Air Force Base, “we have been able to
            confirm that the
            individual G was a woman, using the new test,” Allen said. <br>

            The Vasa which was supposed to go to a naval base outside Stockholm to wait for the boarding of
            the
            soldiers, is
            believed to have sunk because it lacked the ballast to counterweigh its heavy guns.
